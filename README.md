# Manga Downloader with Web Scrapping!
There are free options to read manga online, but in some of them, we aren't able to download 
a PDF version of it to read it later. This is the case of manganelo.tv (https://ww5.manganelo.tv/), 
where we can just read manga in the page from images loading in the web page.

These are manga's examples you can find in Manganelo:
* "*Beyond The Sky*": https://ww5.manganelo.tv/manga/manga-ne990439.
* "*My Wife Is A Fox Spirit*": https://ww5.manganelo.tv/manga/manga-hr984452.
* "*Fight Class 3*": https://ww5.manganelo.tv/manga/manga-cd980038.

Inside every manga's page, we have acces to the list of chapters and their information, 
as we can see in the next screeshot from the "Beyond The Sky"'s page: <br>

And, inside a chapter's page we can see the images: <br>
