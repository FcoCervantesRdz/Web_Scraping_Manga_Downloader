    # Manga Downloader with Web Scrapping!
    There are free options to read manga online, but in some of them, we aren't able to download 
    a PDF version of it to read it later. This is the case of manganelo.tv (https://ww5.manganelo.tv/), 
    where we can just read manga in the page from images loading in the web page.

    These are manga's examples you can find in Manganelo:
    * "*Beyond The Sky*": https://ww5.manganelo.tv/manga/manga-ne990439.
    * "*My Wife Is A Fox Spirit*": https://ww5.manganelo.tv/manga/manga-hr984452.
    * "*Fight Class 3*": https://ww5.manganelo.tv/manga/manga-cd980038.

    Inside every manga's page, we have acces to the list of chapters and their information, 
    as we can see in the next screeshot from the "Beyond The Sky"'s page:

    And, inside a chapter's page we can see the images:
